          <h2>White House confirms end of tariff exemption for cheap Chinese goods</h2>
          <p>The White House has confirmed that cheap Chinese small parcels will no longer be exempt from tariffs starting 2 May, according to an amendment to Trump's executive order published today.</p>
          <p>These items will be subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item, which will increase to $50 after 1 June.</p>
          <p>Previously, goods from China and Hong Kong valued at less than $800 were given the duty free de minimis treatment - meaning they were allowed to enter the US tariff-free.</p>
          <p>The change will most noticeably affect shipments from fast fashion brands like Shein and Temu.</p>

          <h2>'Trump will likely blink before Xi Jinping' - Oxford Economics expert</h2>
          <p>Louise Loo, a lead economist at the Oxford Economics company, has told the BBC that "retaliation and counter-retaliation from the Chinese are almost a given at this stage".</p>
          <p>The Singapore-based economist says China's retaliatory measures are likely to be proportionate, and suggests that Beijing is "leaving the door open to trade talks".</p>
          <p>"We think between Trump, Xi, and... Powell [Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve of the United States], Trump will likely blink first," she adds.</p>
          <p>"The worst case scenario - if bilateral trade flows completely disappear between the two - would cost China 3% of GDP," Ms Loo adds. "It might not have the fiscal means to completely offset that this year, but the longer term trend is that Chinaâ€™s trade has continued to penetrate into other emerging markets, which will mitigate that fallout."</p>

          <p>"The escalation of trade tensions between the US and China will no doubt lead to a sharper decline in China's exports, with spillovers to domestic investment, the labour market, consumption and confidence," says Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist from the Vanguard investment firm.</p>
